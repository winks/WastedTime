# WastedTime

This a bare-bones PoC to track time spent in different applications.

No cloud integration or any kind of network traffic is the main feature.

Windows only.

## Building

```
cargo build --release
```

## Running

```
.\run-release.ps1
```

This will probably not work due to ps1 script execution being blocked, but whatever.
